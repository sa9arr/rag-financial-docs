They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. \"If this tech can be understood...\" Taylor said, their voice quieter, \"It could change the game for us. For all of us.\"\n\nThe underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands.

It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.\n\nThen Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. \"If this tech can be understood...\" Taylor said, their voice quieter, \"It could change the game for us. For all of us.\"\n\nThe underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands. Jordan looked up, and for a fleeting heartbeat, their eyes locked with Taylor's, a wordless clash of wills softening into an uneasy truce.\n\nIt was a small transformation, barely perceptible, but one that Alex noted with an inward nod.

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, Nexon Technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment.

Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.

Policies\n\n## Basis of Presentation and Preparation\n\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively 'Apple' or the 'Company'). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of the Company's management, the condensed consolidated financial statements reflect  all  adjustments,  which  are  normal  and  recurring  in  nature,  necessary  for  fair  financial  statement  presentation.  The  preparation  of  these  condensed consolidated  financial  statements  and  accompanying  notes  in  conformity  with  U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  requires  management  to  make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period's presentation. These condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Company's annual consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 25, 2021.\n\nThe Company's fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company's fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. The Company's fiscal years 2022 and 2021 span 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated,  references  to  particular  years,  quarters,  months  and  periods  refer  to  the  Company's  fiscal  years  ended  in  September  and  the  associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.\n\n## Earnings Per Share\n\nThe following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 25, 2022 and June 26, 2021 (net income in millions and shares in thousands):\n\n|                                           | Three Months Ended   | Three Months Ended   | Nine Months Ended   | Nine Months Ended   |\n|-------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n|                                           | June 25, 2022        | June 26, 2021        | June 25, 2022       | June 26, 2021       |\n| Numerator:                                |                      |                      |                     |                     |\n| Net income                                | $ 19,442             | $ 21,744             | $ 79,082            | $ 74,129            |\n| Denominator:                              |                      |                      |                     |                     |\n| Weighted-average basic shares outstanding | 16,162,945           | 16,629,371           | 16,277,824          | 16,772,656          |\n| Effect of dilutive securities             | 99,258               | 152,364              | 117,113             | 168,871             |\n| Weighted-average diluted shares           | 16,262,203           | 16,781,735           | 16,394,937          | 16,941,527          |\n| Basic earnings per share                  | $ 1.20               | $ 1.31               | $ 4.86              | $ 4.42              |\n| Diluted earnings per share                | $ 1.20               | $ 1.30               | $ 4.82              | $ 4.38              |\n\n## Note 2 - Revenue\n\nNet sales disaggregated by\n######################\nOutput:",

Please find only the missing entities and relationships from previous text.\n\n---Remember Steps---\n\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, use same language as input text. If English, capitalized the name\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event,category]\n- entity_description: Provide a comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities *based solely on the information present in the input text*. **Do not infer or hallucinate information not explicitly stated.** If the text provides insufficient information to create a comprehensive description, state \"Description not available in text.\"\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n- relationship_keywords: one or more high-level key words that summarize the overarching nature of the relationship, focusing on concepts or themes rather than specific details\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_keywords><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Identify high-level key words that summarize the main concepts, themes, or topics of the entire text. These should capture the overarching ideas present in the document.\nFormat the content-level key words as (\"content_keywords\"<|><high_level_keywords>)\n\n4. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n5. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n---Output---\n\nAdd new entities and relations below using the same format, and do not include entities and relations that have been previously extracted. :",

Significant Accounting Policies\\n\\n## Basis of Presentation and Preparation\\n\\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries

Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of the Company's management, the condensed consolidated financial statements reflect  all  adjustments,  which  are  normal  and  recurring  in  nature,  necessary  for  fair  financial  statement  presentation.  The  preparation  of  these  condensed consolidated  financial  statements  and  accompanying  notes  in  conformity  with  U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  requires  management  to  make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period's presentation. These condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Company's annual consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 25, 2021.\\n\\nThe Company's fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company's fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. The Company's fiscal years 2022 and 2021 span 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated,  references  to  particular  years,  quarters,  months  and  periods  refer  to  the  Company's  fiscal  years  ended  in  September  and  the  associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.\\n\\n## Earnings Per Share\\n\\nThe following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 25, 2022 and June 26, 2021 (net income in millions and shares in thousands):\\n\\n|                                           | Three Months Ended   | Three Months Ended   | Nine Months Ended   | Nine Months Ended   |\\n|-------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\\n|                                           | June 25, 2022        | June 26, 2021        | June 25, 2022       | June 26, 2021       |\\n| Numerator:                                |                      |                      |                     |                     |\\n| Net income                                | $ 19,442             | $ 21,744             | $ 79,082            | $ 74,129            |\\n| Denominator:                              |                      |                      |                     |                     |\\n| Weighted-average basic shares outstanding | 16,162,945           | 16,629,371           | 16,277,824          | 16,772,656          |\\n| Effect of dilutive securities             | 99,258               | 152,364              | 117,113             | 168,871             |\\n| Weighted-average diluted shares           | 16,262,203           | 16,781,735           | 16,394,937          | 16,941,527          |\\n| Basic earnings per share                  | $ 1.20               | $ 1.31               | $ 4.86              | $ 4.42              |\\n| Diluted earnings per share                | $ 1.20               | $ 1.30               | $ 4.82              | $ 4.38              |\\n\\n## Note 2 - Revenue\\n\\nNet sales disaggregated by\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Apple Inc.\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"Apple Inc. is a technology company known for its consumer electronics, software, and services.

However, the Company may choose not  to  hedge  certain  exposures  for  a  variety  of  reasons,  including  accounting  considerations  or  the  prohibitive  economic  cost  of  hedging  particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Risk\n\nTo  protect  gross  margins  from  fluctuations  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates,  the  Company  may  enter  into  forward  contracts,  option  contracts  or  other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.\n\nTo protect the Company's foreign currency-denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into  forward  contracts,  cross-currency  swaps  or  other  instruments. The  Company  designates  these  instruments  as  either  cash  flow  or  fair  value hedges. As of June 25, 2022, the Company's hedged term debt- and marketable securities-related foreign currency transactions are expected to be recognized within 20 years.\n\nThe Company may also enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.\n\n## Interest Rate Risk\n\nTo protect the Company's term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges.\n\nThe notional amounts of the Company's outstanding derivative instruments as of June 25, 2022 and September 25, 2021 were as follows (in millions):\n\n|                                                             | June 25, 2022   | September 25, 2021   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|----------------------|\n| Derivative instruments designated as accounting hedges:     |                 |                      |\n| Foreign exchange contracts                                  | $ 76,234        | $ 76,475             |\n| Interest rate contracts                                     | $ 20,775        | $ 16,875             |\n| Derivative instruments not designated as accounting hedges: |                 |                      |\n| Foreign exchange contracts                                  | $ 84,506        | $ 126,918            |\n\nThe gross fair values of the Company's derivative assets and liabilities were not material as of June 25, 2022 and September 25, 2021.\n\nThe gains and losses recognized in other comprehensive income/(loss) and amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income/(\n######################\nOutput:",

small and mid-sized businesses  and  education,  enterprise  and  government  customers.  The  Company  generally  does  not  require  collateral  from  its  customers;  however,  the Company will require collateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These creditfinancing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.\n\nThe Company's cellular network carriers accounted for 36% and 42% of total trade receivables as of June 25, 2022 and September 25, 2021, respectively.\n\n## Vendor Non-Trade Receivables\n\nThe Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture subassemblies  or  assemble  final  products  for  the  Company.

Total fair value                   | $ 131,077  |\\n\\n## Derivative Instruments and Hedging\\n\\nThe Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. However, the Company may choose not  to  hedge  certain  exposures  for  a  variety  of  reasons,  including  accounting  considerations  or  the  prohibitive  economic  cost  of  hedging  particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates.\\n\\n## Foreign Exchange Risk\\n\\nTo  protect  gross  margins  from  fluctuations  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates,  the  Company  may  enter  into  forward  contracts,  option  contracts  or  other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.\\n\\nTo protect the Company's foreign currency-denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into  forward  contracts,  cross-currency  swaps  or  other  instruments. The  Company  designates  these  instruments  as  either  cash  flow  or  fair  value hedges. As of June 25, 2022, the Company's hedged term debt- and marketable securities-related foreign currency transactions are expected to be recognized within 20 years.\\n\\nThe Company may also enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.\\n\\n## Interest Rate Risk\\n\\nTo protect the Company's term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges.\\n\\nThe notional amounts of the Company's outstanding derivative instruments as of June 25, 2022 and September 25, 2021 were as follows (in millions):\\n\\n|                                                             | June 25, 2022   | September 25, 2021   |\\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|----------------------|\\n| Derivative instruments designated as accounting hedges:     |                 |                      |\\n| Foreign exchange contracts                                  | $ 76,234        | $ 76,475             |\\n| Interest rate contracts                                     | $ 20,775        | $ 16,875             |\\n| Derivative instruments not designated as accounting hedges: |                 |                      |\\n| Foreign exchange contracts                                  | $ 84,506        | $ 126,918            |\\n\\nThe gross fair values of the Company's derivative assets and liabilities were not material as of June 25, 2022 and September 25, 2021.\\n\\nThe gains and losses recognized in other comprehensive income/(loss) and amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income/(\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Company\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"The Company is involved in managing marketable securities, including debt instruments, and employs various financial strategies such as foreign exchange and interest rate hedging.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Certificates of Deposit\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Certificates of deposit are a type of time deposit held in banks and are included in the Company's financial instruments portfolio.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Commercial Paper\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Commercial paper is an unsecured, short-term debt instrument issued by the Company for financing needs.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Corporate Debt Securities\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Corporate debt securities refer to bonds or notes issued by the Company to raise capital.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Municipal Securities\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Municipal securities are debt obligations issued by local government entities included in the Company's financial instruments.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Mortgage- and Asset-Backed Securities\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"These are investment products backed by mortgages or other loans, which are part of the Company's portfolio.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Foreign Exchange Contracts\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Foreign exchange contracts are derivative instruments used by the Company to hedge against foreign currency fluctuations.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Interest Rate Swaps\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Interest rate swaps are financial derivatives the Company uses to manage exposure to interest rate fluctuations.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Forward Contracts\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Forward contracts are agreements to exchange currencies with the aim of managing foreign exchange risks.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Company\\\"<|>\\\"Foreign Exchange Contracts\\\"<|>\\\"The Company utilizes foreign exchange contracts as a strategy to manage risks related to currency fluctuations.\\\"<|>\\\"risk management, financial strategy\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Company\\\"<|>\\\"Interest Rate Swaps\\\"<|>\\\"Interest rate swaps are part of the Company's strategy to hedge against fluctuations in interest rates.\\\"<|>\\\"financial instruments, risk management\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Company\\\"<|>\\\"Certificates of Deposit\\\"<|>\\\"Certificates of deposit are part of the Company's financial instruments portfolio for managing liquidity.\\\"<|>\\\"financial management, liquidity\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Company\\\"<|>\\\"Commercial Paper\\\"<|>\\\"Commercial paper is used by the Company to meet short-term financing requirements.\\\"<|>\\\"short-term financing\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Company\\\"<|>\\\"Mortgage- and Asset-Backed Securities\\\"<|>\\\"The Company includes mortgage- and asset-backed securities as part of its investment portfolio.\\\"<|>\\\"investment strategy\\\"<|>6)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"financial management, marketable securities, risk hedging, foreign exchange, interest rates\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

wholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and mid-sized businesses  and  education,  enterprise  and  government  customers.  The  Company  generally  does  not  require  collateral  from  its  customers;  however,  the Company will require collateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These creditfinancing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.\\n\\nThe Company's cellular network carriers accounted for 36% and 42% of total trade receivables as of June 25, 2022 and September 25, 2021, respectively.\\n\\n## Vendor Non-Trade Receivables\\n\\nThe Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture subassemblies  or  assemble  final  products  for  the  Company.  The  Company  purchases  these  components  directly  from  suppliers. As  of  June  25,  2022,  the Company  had  two  vendors  that  individually  represented  10%  or  more  of  total  vendor  non-trade  receivables,  which  accounted  for  54%  and  12%.  As  of September 25, 2021, the Company had three vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 52%, 11% and 11%.\\n\\n## Note 4 -

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\nThis  section  and  other  parts  of  this  Quarterly  Report  on  Form  10-Q  ('Form  10-Q')  contain  forward-looking  statements,  within  the  meaning  of  the  Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-Q regarding the potential future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company's business and results of operations are forward-looking statements . Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as 'future,' 'anticipates,' 'believes,' 'estimates,' 'expects,' 'intends,' 'plans,' 'predicts,' 'will,' 'would,' 'could,' 'can,' 'may,' and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company's actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 25, 2021 (the '2021 Form 10-K') under the heading 'Risk Factors.' The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.\n\nUnless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company's fiscal calendar, and references to particular years, quarters, months or periods refer to the Company's fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Each of the terms the 'Company' and 'Apple' as used herein refers collectively to Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated.\n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2021 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the 'SEC') and the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.\n\n## Available Information\n\nThe  Company  periodically  provides  certain  information  for  investors on  its  corporate  website,  www.apple.com,  and  its  investor  relations  website, investor.apple.com.  This  includes  press  releases  and  other  information  about  financial  performance,  information  on  environmental,  social  and  corporate governance matters, and details related to the Company's annual meeting of shareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-Q is not incorporated by reference into this filing. Further, the Company's references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only.\n\n## Business Seasonality and Product Introductions\n\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net  sales  in  its  first  quarter  compared  to  other  quarters  in  its  fiscal  year  due  in  part  to  seasonal  holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company's net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction.\n\n## Quarterly Highlights\n\nTotal  net  sales  increased  2%  or  $1.5  billion  during  the  third  quarter  of  2022  compared  to  the  same  quarter  in  2021,  driven  primarily  by  higher  net  sales  of Services and iPhone, partially offset by lower net sales of Mac and Wearables, Home and Accessories. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact on all Products and Services net sales during the third quarter of 2022.\n\nAt the end of the third quarter of 2022, the Company introduced an all-new MacBook Air and an updated 13-inch MacBook Pro ,  both powered by the new Apple M2 chip. The Company also announced iOS 16, macOS Ventura, iPadOS 16 and watchOS 9, updates to its operating systems that are expected to be\n######################\nOutput:",

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, Nexon Technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings.

   |\\n\\n## Item 2.    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\\n\\nThis  section  and  other  parts  of  this  Quarterly  Report  on  Form  10-Q  ('Form  10-Q')  contain  forward-looking  statements,  within  the  meaning  of  the  Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-Q regarding the potential future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company's business and results of operations are forward-looking statements . Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as 'future,' 'anticipates,' 'believes,' 'estimates,' 'expects,' 'intends,' 'plans,' 'predicts,' 'will,' 'would,' 'could,' 'can,' 'may,' and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company's actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 25, 2021 (the '2021 Form 10-K') under the heading 'Risk Factors.' The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.\\n\\nUnless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company's fiscal calendar, and references to particular years, quarters, months or periods refer to the Company's fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Each of the terms the 'Company' and 'Apple' as used herein refers collectively to Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated.\\n\\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2021 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the 'SEC') and the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.\\n\\n## Available Information\\n\\nThe  Company  periodically  provides  certain  information  for  investors on  its  corporate  website,  www.apple.com,  and  its  investor  relations  website, investor.apple.com.  This  includes  press  releases  and  other  information  about  financial  performance,  information  on  environmental,  social  and  corporate governance matters, and details related to the Company's annual meeting of shareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-Q is not incorporated by reference into this filing. Further, the Company's references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only.\\n\\n## Business Seasonality and Product Introductions\\n\\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net  sales  in  its  first  quarter  compared  to  other  quarters  in  its  fiscal  year  due  in  part  to  seasonal  holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company's net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction.\\n\\n## Quarterly Highlights\\n\\nTotal  net  sales  increased  2%  or  $1.5  billion  during  the  third  quarter  of  2022  compared  to  the  same  quarter  in  2021,  driven  primarily  by  higher  net  sales  of Services and iPhone, partially offset by lower net sales of Mac and Wearables, Home and Accessories. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact on all Products and Services net sales during the third quarter of 2022.\\n\\nAt the end of the third quarter of 2022, the Company introduced an all-new MacBook Air and an updated 13-inch MacBook Pro ,  both powered by the new Apple M2 chip. The Company also announced iOS 16, macOS Ventura, iPadOS 16 and watchOS 9, updates to its operating systems that are expected to be\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Apple Inc.\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"Apple Inc. is a technology company known for its consumer electronics, software, and services, with reported financial results including net sales and product introductions.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"COVID-19 Pandemic\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"The COVID-19 pandemic is referenced as a factor that may impact Apple's business and results of operations in future projections.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) oversees the securities industry and requires public companies like Apple to file reports such as the Form 10-K.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"MacBook Air\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"The MacBook Air is a product introduced by Apple, specifically an all-new model powered by the Apple M2 chip.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"MacBook Pro\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"The 13-inch MacBook Pro is an updated product from Apple, powered by the Apple M2 chip, enhancing the company's laptop offerings.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"iOS 16\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"iOS 16 is an update to Apple's mobile operating system that is part of the product announcements during the third quarter of 2022.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"macOS Ventura\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"macOS Ventura is an update to Apple's operating system for Mac computers, announced alongside other product updates.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"iPadOS 16\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"iPadOS 16 is an updated operating system for Apple's iPad devices, part of the latest software announcements.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"watchOS 9\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"watchOS 9 is an update to the operating system for Apple Watch devices, announced as part of the software updates.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Apple Inc.\\\"<|>\\\"COVID-19 Pandemic\\\"<|>\\\"Apple Inc. mentions the COVID-19 pandemic as a risk factor that may affect its future business performance.\\\"<|>\\\"risk factor, business impact\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Apple Inc.\\\"<|>\\\"U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\\\"<|>\\\"Apple Inc. is required to file reports with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, indicating regulatory compliance.\\\"<|>\\\"regulatory compliance, reporting\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Apple Inc.\\\"<|>\\\"MacBook Air\\\"<|>\\\"The introduction of the new MacBook Air is a significant product development by Apple Inc., affecting its sales and operations.\\\"<|>\\\"product launch, sales impact\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Apple Inc.\\\"<|>\\\"MacBook Pro\\\"<|>\\\"The updated MacBook Pro represents a key product update in Apple's range of offerings, contributing to sales increases.\\\"<|>\\\"product update, sales impact\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Apple Inc.\\\"<|>\\\"iOS 16\\\"<|>\\\"The announcement of iOS 16 indicates Apple's ongoing commitment to enhancing its software ecosystem.\\\"<|>\\\"software update, ecosystem enhancement\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Apple Inc.\\\"<|>\\\"macOS Ventura\\\"<|>\\\"macOS Ventura's announcement shows Apple's strategy to update and improve its operating systems regularly.\\\"<|>\\\"software update, regular enhancement\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Apple Inc.\\\"<|>\\\"iPadOS 16\\\"<|>\\\"The update to iPadOS 16 illustrates the company's focus on improving product features across its device range.\\\"<|>\\\"software update, product improvement\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Apple Inc.\\\"<|>\\\"watchOS 9\\\"<|>\\\"watchOS 9 being announced showcases Apple's continuous innovation in wearables and operating systems.\\\"<|>\\\"innovation, wearable technology\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"financial reporting, product launches, business risks, technology updates\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

The Company's effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2022 was higher compared to the same period in 2021 due primarily to a higher effective tax rate on foreign earnings, lower tax benefits from share-based compensation, and the impact to U.S. foreign tax credits as a result of regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in January 2022.\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\nThe Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond.\n\nThe Company's contractual cash requirements have not changed materially since the 2021 Form 10-K, except for manufacturing purchase obligations.\n\n## Manufacturing Purchase Obligations\n\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company's products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. As of June 25, 2022, the Company  had  manufacturing  purchase  obligations  of  $43.1  billion,\n######################\nOutput:",

The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. As of June 25, 2022, the Company  had  manufacturing  purchase  obligations  of  $43.1  billion,  with  $43.0  billion  payable  within  12  months.  The  Company's  manufacturing  purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable.\n\nIn  addition  to  its  contractual  cash  requirements,  the  Company  has  a  share  repurchase  program  authorized  by  the  Board  of  Directors  (the  'Program').  The Program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of June 25, 2022, the Company's quarterly cash dividend was $0.23 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors.\n\n## Critical Accounting Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Company's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company's management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, 'Summary of Significant Accounting Policies' of the Notes to condensed consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 2021 Form 10-K describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements. There have been no material changes to the Company's critical accounting estimates since the 2021 Form 10-K.\n\n## Item 3.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n\nThere have been no material changes to the Company's market risk during the first nine months of 2022. For a discussion of the Company's exposure to market risk, refer to the Company's market risk disclosures set forth in Part II, Item 7A, 'Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk' of the 2021 Form 10-K.\n\n## Item 4.    Controls and Procedures\n\n## Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\nBased on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, the Company's principal executive officer and principal financial  officer  have  concluded  that  the  Company's  disclosure  controls  and  procedures  as  defined  in  Rules  13a-15(e)  and  15d-15(e)  under  the  Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 'Exchange Act') were effective as of June 25, 2022 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified  in  the  SEC  rules  and  forms  and  (ii)  accumulated  and  communicated  to  the  Company's  management,  including  its  principal  executive  officer  and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n\n## Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nThere were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the third quarter of 2022, which were identified in connection with management's evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## PART II - OTHER INFORMATION\n\n## Item 1.    Legal Proceedings\n\n## Epic Games\n\nEpic Games, Inc. ('Epic') filed  a  lawsuit  in  the  U.S.  District  Court  for  the  Northern  District  of  California  (the  'Northern  California  District  Court')  against  the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California's unfair competition law based upon the Company's operation of its App Store. The Company filed a counterclaim for breach of contract. On September 10, 2021, the Northern California District Court ruled in favor of the Company with respect to nine out of the ten counts included in Epic's claim, and in favor of the Company with respect to the Company's claims for breach of contract. The Northern California District Court found that certain provisions of the Company's App Store Review Guidelines violate California's unfair competition law and issued an injunction. Epic appealed the decision. The Company filed a cross-appeal and has been granted a stay pending the appeal.\n\n## Other Legal Proceedings\n\nThe Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the third quarter of 2022 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company's financial condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for  amounts above management's expectations, the Company's financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.\n\n## Item 1A.    Risk Factors\n\nThe Company's business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition, as well as the price of the Company's stock, can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described in Part I, Item 1A of the 2021 Form 10-K under the heading 'Risk Factors.'

[organization,person,geo,event,category]\\nText:\\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company's products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. As of June 25, 2022, the Company  had  manufacturing  purchase  obligations  of  $43.1  billion,  with  $43.0  billion  payable  within  12  months.  The  Company's  manufacturing  purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable.\\n\\nIn  addition  to  its  contractual  cash  requirements,  the  Company  has  a  share  repurchase  program  authorized  by  the  Board  of  Directors  (the  'Program').  The Program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of June 25, 2022, the Company's quarterly cash dividend was $0.23 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors.\\n\\n## Critical Accounting Estimates\\n\\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Company's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company's management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, 'Summary of Significant Accounting Policies' of the Notes to condensed consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 2021 Form 10-K describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements. There have been no material changes to the Company's critical accounting estimates since the 2021 Form 10-K.\\n\\n## Item 3.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\\n\\nThere have been no material changes to the Company's market risk during the first nine months of 2022. For a discussion of the Company's exposure to market risk, refer to the Company's market risk disclosures set forth in Part II, Item 7A, 'Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk' of the 2021 Form 10-K.\\n\\n## Item 4.    Controls and Procedures\\n\\n## Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\\n\\nBased on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, the Company's principal executive officer and principal financial  officer  have  concluded  that  the  Company's  disclosure  controls  and  procedures  as  defined  in  Rules  13a-15(e)  and  15d-15(e)  under  the  Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 'Exchange Act') were effective as of June 25, 2022 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified  in  the  SEC  rules  and  forms  and  (ii)  accumulated  and  communicated  to  the  Company's  management,  including  its  principal  executive  officer  and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\\n\\n## Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\n\\nThere were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the third quarter of 2022, which were identified in connection with management's evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\\n\\n## PART II - OTHER INFORMATION\\n\\n## Item 1.    Legal Proceedings\\n\\n## Epic Games\\n\\nEpic Games, Inc. ('Epic') filed  a  lawsuit  in  the  U.S.  District  Court  for  the  Northern  District  of  California  (the  'Northern  California  District  Court')  against  the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California's unfair competition law based upon the Company's operation of its App Store. The Company filed a counterclaim for breach of contract. On September 10, 2021, the Northern California District Court ruled in favor of the Company with respect to nine out of the ten counts included in Epic's claim, and in favor of the Company with respect to the Company's claims for breach of contract. The Northern California District Court found that certain provisions of the Company's App Store Review Guidelines violate California's unfair competition law and issued an injunction. Epic appealed the decision. The Company filed a cross-appeal and has been granted a stay pending the appeal.\\n\\n## Other Legal Proceedings\\n\\nThe Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the third quarter of 2022 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company's financial condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for  amounts above management's expectations, the Company's financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.\\n\\n## Item 1A.    Risk Factors\\n\\nThe Company's business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition, as well as the price of the Company's stock, can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described in Part I, Item 1A of the 2021 Form 10-K under the heading 'Risk Factors.'
